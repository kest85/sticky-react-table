Many large-scale applications require the use of tables somewhere, if not everywhere. Many a times the requirements for these tables are quite complex and difficult to manage. **Sticky React Table** aims to solve all of these problems for React developers, with a host of features including customizable cells, rows, and headers, column switching, column filtering, sorting, virtualization, column resizing, etc. All of that, provided in a declarative manner, and built ground-up, especially for React!

The package is still under development. We are working actively to get this package to a stable release as soon as possible. Please do not use this package in any production application.
